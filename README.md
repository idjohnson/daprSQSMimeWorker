## Deployment

You will want to update the two kubernetes YAML files :

- sqsbinding.yaml (for your AWS keys)
- sqswatcher.dep.yaml (for your container registry and registry secret in the namespace)

Then update `runit.sh` to also reference that container registry.

I was updating this rather frequently so i wrote a 1-2 punch deployment:

```
